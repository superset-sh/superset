Superset and Cursor both aim to make developers faster with AI, but they take fundamentally different approaches. Cursor replaces your code editor with one that has AI woven into every interaction. Superset sits outside your editor entirely and orchestrates multiple AI coding agents running in parallel, each in its own isolated Git worktree.

They are different tools solving different problems. Cursor is an AI-powered IDE. Superset is an orchestration layer for autonomous coding agents. Understanding this distinction matters, because the right choice depends on how you work with AI today and how you want to work with it going forward.

## What Is Superset?

Superset is a desktop application that functions as a terminal built specifically for AI coding agents. Instead of running one agent at a time, Superset lets you spin up 10 or more in parallel, each working on a different task in its own isolated Git worktree.

The key idea is agent-agnosticism. Superset does not ship its own AI model. It orchestrates whatever CLI-based coding tools you already use — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Aider, or any other terminal-based agent. You bring your own API keys, and Superset handles parallel execution, branch isolation, and code review.

Each agent gets its own worktree: its own branch, working directory, and file changes. Agents cannot interfere with each other or your main working tree. When an agent finishes, you review the diff in Superset's built-in viewer and decide whether to merge.

Superset integrates with VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, and Xcode. It runs locally, collects no telemetry, and is completely open source.

## What Is Cursor?

Cursor is an AI-native code editor built as a fork of VS Code. It replaces your existing editor with one that deeply integrates AI into the coding experience: inline completions (Tab), an AI chat panel (Cmd+L), an inline edit command (Cmd+K), and Composer for multi-file edits.

Cursor's strength is the tightness of its integration. The AI sees your open files, understands your project structure through codebase indexing, and makes suggestions that account for your full context. Asking Cursor to refactor a function or implement a feature feels fluid — it proposes changes as diffs, and you accept or reject them inline.

Cursor routes requests through its own servers and offers access to multiple foundation models (GPT-5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and others). You do not need your own API keys, but your code does pass through Cursor's infrastructure. Pricing starts with a limited free tier, with Pro at $20/month, Pro+ at $60/month, and Ultra at $200/month. In mid-2025, Cursor shifted to a credit-based billing model, which caused community friction due to unpredictable costs.

Cursor also recently added Background Agents — cloud-based environments that clone your repo, work on a task autonomously, and open a pull request. This moves Cursor toward the agent orchestration paradigm, though it runs in the cloud rather than locally and requires disabling Privacy Mode.

## The Core Difference: Orchestrator vs Editor

The fundamental architectural distinction is this: Cursor is an editor that contains AI. Superset is an orchestrator that runs alongside any editor.

This difference shapes everything downstream.

### Single-Agent Flow vs Multi-Agent Parallelism

Cursor is optimized for a single developer working with a single AI assistant. You ask the AI to complete a function, refactor a module, or implement a feature. The AI responds, you review, you iterate. Fast and fluid for focused, one-at-a-time work.

Superset is optimized for running many agents simultaneously. Assign one agent to write tests, another to refactor a service layer, a third to update documentation, and a fourth to fix lint errors — all at the same time, each in its own worktree on its own branch.

These are different levels of the stack. One makes a single AI interaction better. The other runs many AI interactions concurrently.

### Editor Lock-In vs Editor Freedom

Cursor requires you to use Cursor. You get tight AI integration in exchange for adopting a specific editor. For VS Code users, the transition is smooth. For JetBrains, Xcode, or Neovim users, it means leaving your current editor behind.

Superset does not touch your editor. You can use it alongside VS Code, Cursor itself, JetBrains, Xcode, or anything else. Switch editors next year and Superset still works.

### Model Lock-In vs Model Freedom

Cursor routes all AI requests through its servers. You get access to a range of models, but through Cursor's infrastructure, subject to its credit system and rate limits.

Superset does not provide AI models. It runs whatever CLI agents you point it at. Use Claude Code today, switch to Codex tomorrow, change nothing in Superset. A new agent launches next week — you can run it inside Superset that day. Your API keys, your models, your choice.

## Feature Comparison

### AI-Assisted Editing

Cursor excels here. Its inline completions are fast and context-aware. The Cmd+K inline edit and Composer multi-file edit features let you describe changes in natural language and see them applied as diffs. This is what Cursor was built for, and it does it well.

Superset does not provide inline completions or in-editor AI features. It is not an editor. For AI-assisted editing, you use your editor's own tools (Copilot, Cursor, JetBrains AI, or others) alongside Superset.

**Edge: Cursor**, clearly. For single-file and inline AI editing, Cursor's integrated experience is hard to beat.

### Parallel Task Execution

Superset's core feature. Launch multiple agents across multiple worktrees, each tackling a separate task. The isolation is real — each agent has its own branch and working directory. A built-in diff viewer lets you review what each agent produced.

Cursor's Background Agents address parallelism, but they run in the cloud. They clone your repo to a remote VM, do the work, and open a PR. This introduces latency, requires granting repo access to Cursor, and needs Privacy Mode disabled.

Running agents locally with Superset means your code never leaves your machine and you are not limited by anyone else's credit system.

**Edge: Superset**. Local parallel agent execution with worktree isolation is the core product, not a bolt-on feature.

### Code Review and Diff Workflow

Superset includes a built-in diff viewer designed for reviewing agent output. When an agent finishes a task, you see the changes it made across files, review them, and decide whether to merge the branch.

Cursor shows diffs inline during Composer edits — you accept or reject changes as they are proposed. Background Agent output comes as a PR, which you review through your normal GitHub workflow.

Both approaches work. Superset's is optimized for reviewing completed autonomous work across many files. Cursor's is optimized for iterating on changes in real time.

**Edge: Depends on workflow.** Real-time iteration favors Cursor. Reviewing completed agent work favors Superset.

### Privacy and Data Handling

Superset runs entirely locally. No telemetry. No data collection. Your code never leaves your machine (beyond what your chosen CLI agents send to their API providers). The application is open source and auditable.

Cursor sends code to its servers and third-party providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) for AI processing. Privacy Mode enables a zero-data-retention agreement, but code still transits external servers. Background Agents require Privacy Mode to be disabled entirely. Cursor also disclosed security vulnerabilities in 2025, including the CurXecute flaw (CVE-2025-54135) that allowed arbitrary command execution.

For developers working on proprietary or sensitive codebases, this distinction matters significantly.

**Edge: Superset**. Local-only processing with no telemetry is a meaningfully stronger privacy posture.

## Pricing

| Plan | **Superset** | **Cursor** |
|---|---|---|
| Free | Full product, all features, unlimited usage | 50 requests/month (limited) |
| Individual | Free | $20/month (Pro) |
| Power user | Free | $60/month (Pro+) or $200/month (Ultra) |
| Team | Free | $40/user/month |
| Enterprise | Free | Custom pricing |

Superset is free and open source. No paid tier. You pay only for the API keys you use with whatever agents you run.

Cursor shifted to credit-based billing in mid-2025, which has been a point of contention. Users report exhausting monthly credits faster than expected, particularly with more capable models. The credit system makes costs harder to predict than a flat rate.

"Free" for Superset does not mean zero cost overall — running Claude Code or Codex requires API access. But those costs are transparent, with no markup and no opaque credit system.

## Who Should Use Cursor

Cursor is the right tool if you want AI deeply embedded in your editing experience. Specifically:

- **You primarily use VS Code.** The transition to Cursor is smooth, and you get a significantly more powerful AI experience than any VS Code extension can provide.
- **You work on one task at a time.** Cursor's single-agent flow (inline completions, Chat, Composer) is excellent for focused, sequential work.
- **You value convenience over control.** Cursor handles model access, prompt engineering, and context management for you. You do not need to manage API keys or choose between agents.
- **You are comfortable with cloud processing.** Your code going through Cursor's servers is acceptable for your use case.

Cursor is genuinely good at what it does. The inline editing experience is polished, the codebase awareness is strong, and for developers who live in a single editor doing one thing at a time, it removes meaningful friction.

## Who Should Use Superset

Superset is the right tool if your AI workflow involves running autonomous agents and you want to do more in parallel. Specifically:

- **You run CLI-based coding agents.** Claude Code, Codex, Aider, or any terminal-based agent. Superset orchestrates them.
- **You want to parallelize.** Instead of assigning one task, waiting, reviewing, then assigning the next, you assign ten tasks and review them as they complete.
- **You have your own editor preferences.** You use JetBrains, Xcode, Neovim, or anything else and do not want to switch to a VS Code fork.
- **Privacy is non-negotiable.** Your code stays on your machine. No telemetry. No third-party server processing (beyond what your chosen agents do).
- **You want agent flexibility.** No lock-in to a specific model provider. Use whatever agent works best for each task.

Superset is for developers who have adopted autonomous coding agents and want to scale that workflow horizontally.

---

## Can You Use Both?

Yes. This is not an either-or decision.

A reasonable workflow: use Cursor as your editor for its inline AI features and real-time coding assistance. Use Superset alongside it to run parallel agents for larger tasks — test generation, refactors, migrations, documentation updates — that benefit from autonomous execution across multiple worktrees.

Cursor handles the "AI pair programmer sitting next to you" use case. Superset handles the "dispatch a team of AI agents to work on separate tasks while you focus on something else" use case.

They operate at different layers. Cursor is where you write code interactively. Superset is where you orchestrate autonomous work.

---

## Verdict

Cursor is the best AI code editor available. If you want an AI copilot embedded in your editing experience and are comfortable adopting a new IDE, Cursor delivers. The inline completions are fast, multi-file editing is powerful, and codebase awareness makes suggestions genuinely useful.

Superset is not trying to be an editor. It solves a different problem: how do you run many AI agents in parallel, on separate tasks, with proper isolation, without giving up control over your tools or your data?

If you work with one AI assistant at a time inside your editor, Cursor is excellent. If you run autonomous agents from the terminal and want to scale to 10+ parallel tasks, Superset is built for that. If you want both, use both.

The bigger question is where AI-assisted development is heading. Editor-integrated AI is powerful for real-time collaboration with a single model. Agent orchestration is powerful for parallelizing autonomous work across many models and tasks. Both patterns are growing, and they serve different moments in a developer's day.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Superset a Cursor replacement?

No. Superset is not an editor or IDE. It does not provide inline completions, syntax highlighting, or file editing. Superset is a terminal application for orchestrating AI coding agents in parallel. You can use Superset alongside Cursor — or alongside any other editor.

### Can I use Cursor's AI inside Superset?

Cursor's AI features are built into the Cursor editor and are not available as a standalone CLI agent. However, you can use the underlying models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) through their respective CLI agents inside Superset.

### Does Cursor support parallel agents?

Cursor added Background Agents, which run tasks in cloud-based VMs and produce pull requests. This enables a form of parallelism, but the agents run remotely, require disabling Privacy Mode, and are tied to Cursor's credit system. Superset runs agents locally with no cloud dependency.

### Is Superset really free?

Superset itself is free and open source with no paid tiers. You will need API keys for whatever AI agents you run (e.g., an Anthropic key for Claude Code or an OpenAI key for Codex), and those providers charge for usage. But there is no Superset subscription, no credit system, and no markup.

### Which is better for a team?

For teams that want a standardized AI-enhanced editor, Cursor's Teams plan ($40/user/month) provides admin controls, shared configurations, and usage analytics. For teams that want developers to use their preferred editors while running parallel agents, Superset's open-source model has no per-seat cost and no centralized billing.
