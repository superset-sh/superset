## Required Updates <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/552" />

- Desktop app enforces a minimum required version via a remote endpoint
- New "Update Required" screen guides blocked users to check, download, or install updates
- App exposes its current version to the UI so version comparisons are accurate
- Fail-open behavior when API is unreachable, re-checks when network comes back online

## Confirm on Quit <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/524" />

- Added a "Behavior" section in Settings with a "Confirm before quitting" toggle (defaults to enabled)
- App now shows a quit confirmation dialog when enabled and respects the toggle across restarts
- Update/install flows and programmatic quits can skip the confirmation to avoid blocking updates
