## Split Auto-Apply Preset Settings <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1320" />

Configure terminal preset auto-apply behavior independently for workspace creation and new tabs. You can now disable preset auto-apply on new tabs while keeping it on workspace creation, or vice versa.

- "Apply preset on workspace creation" controls initialization commands when creating workspaces
- "Apply preset on new tab" controls whether presets run when opening new tabs/panes/splits
- Explicit preset launches (via hotkey/menu) work regardless of settings

## Enhanced Chat Interface <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1309" />

The AI chat interface now supports slash commands with autocomplete and rich tool rendering.

- Type `/` to see available commands with fuzzy search and keyboard navigation
- Tool calls render with specialized UI for bash output, web searches, file diffs, and user questions
- Session history scanning and restore from Claude Code sessions
- File mention feature with `@` command for tagging files in messages <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1307" />

## Sidebar Refinements

**Workspace-specific base branch** - Base branch selection in the Changes view is now scoped per workspace instead of global, fixing unexpected diff comparisons across workspaces <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1329" />

**Preserved file explorer state** - File explorer now maintains expanded folders, scroll position, and selection when switching between Changes and Files tabs <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1297" />

**Compact tab buttons** - Changes and Files tab buttons collapse to icon-only mode with tooltips when sidebar width is below 250px <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1334" />

## Improvements

- **Edit mode for diffs** - Toggle between read-only and editable Monaco diff viewer in changes view with Ctrl+S to save <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1308" />
- **Improved new tab buttons** - Grouped outline button bar for New Terminal and New Chat with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+T, Cmd+Shift+T) <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1321" />
- **Setup script card** - Persistent sidebar card replaces toast for missing setup scripts with direct link to configuration <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1270" />
- **Chat session persistence** - Chat sessions now survive app restart with local session storage and restore <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1287" />
- **Push auto-setup** - First `git push` from worktrees automatically creates remote branch and sets upstream tracking <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1267" />
- **Project image toggle** - Hide/show project GitHub avatars in sidebar with colored initial letters as fallback <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1276" />
- **Teardown logs modal** - Failed teardown scripts show logs in a modal instead of dumping output in error toast <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1277" />
