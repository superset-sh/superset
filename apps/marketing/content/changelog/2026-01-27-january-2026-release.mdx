## Git Fetch and Pull Actions

You can now easily fetch and pull changes from your remote repository directly from the desktop app. Access these actions from the workspace menu or use the keyboard shortcuts for quick access.

This makes it simple to stay up-to-date with your team's changes without leaving your workspace.

## Rebinded Preset Hotkeys

We've updated the preset hotkeys from `Cmd+Shift+Number` to `Ctrl+Number` for better ergonomics and to avoid conflicts with system shortcuts. This change applies across all platforms.

## Improvements

- Improved workspace switching performance
- Better error handling for git operations
- Enhanced terminal responsiveness
- Updated UI components for better accessibility
- Faster project loading times

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where workspaces would not load correctly on startup
- Resolved terminal color rendering issues
- Fixed keyboard shortcut conflicts on Windows
- Addressed memory leak in long-running terminal sessions
