We're excited to announce the January 2026 release of Superset with several new features and improvements.

## New Features

### Git Fetch and Pull Actions

You can now easily fetch and pull changes from your remote repository directly from the desktop app. Access these actions from the workspace menu or use the keyboard shortcuts.

### Rebinded Preset Hotkeys

We've updated the preset hotkeys from `Cmd+Shift+Number` to `Ctrl+Number` for better ergonomics and to avoid conflicts with system shortcuts.

## Improvements

- Improved workspace switching performance
- Better error handling for git operations
- Enhanced terminal responsiveness
- Updated UI components for better accessibility

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where workspaces would not load correctly on startup
- Resolved terminal color rendering issues
- Fixed keyboard shortcut conflicts on Windows
