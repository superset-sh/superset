## Diff Highlights in Scrollbar <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/725" />

Enable Monaco's overview ruler in the diff viewer to show colored markers in the scrollbar. Additions (green) and deletions (red) are now visible in the scrollbar for quick navigation.

## Shell Environment Fix <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/720" />

- App now captures and applies the user's shell environment on macOS/Linux during startup
- Terminal-related settings (like PATH and ZDOTDIR) are now available when launching from Finder/Spotlight
- Improved handling and merging of PATH entries to prevent terminal initialization issues

## Scroll to Bottom Button <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/700" />

Add a floating scroll-to-bottom button that appears when the terminal is scrolled up. Button uses a chevron icon and animates in/out smoothly. Shows keyboard shortcut in tooltip when available.
