Right now at Superset, we're able to reliably manage 5-7 coding agents in parallel - whether that's Claude Code, Codex, etc. -
at a time. Our goal is to be able to each reliably manage 100 coding agents in parallel by the end of 2026. 

Most people believe that the path from seven to 100 agents is better models, faster inference, and smarter agents. It's not.
Agent compute is already cheap enough, you can run hundreds of agents a month all cheaper than the cost of one engineer.

What's stopping us is every agent needs a human to review its code, give feedback, and decide what to work on next. Scale 
the agents all you want - it's the humans that don't scale. We aim to solve this problem.

# Mapping out the problem

You can pretty much imagine the agent loop as a pipeline:

[Insert an image of the pipeline, You come up with an idea → You plan the task → You hand it to an agent → Agent
  works → You review → You give feedback → Agent revises → You review again → You
   merge]

A human is involved in pretty much every step, and each of these steps has a steep context-switching 
cost - you have to open that agent's code, spin up dev servers, click through the UI to verify their work, give 
feedback and more. It's an insane amount of whiplash to put yourself through on a normal day.

At 100 agents, this model completely breaks. You can't review 100 diffs a day. You can't context-switch between 100
streams of work, at least without the right tooling.

Framing this as an optimization problem makes the solution clear - we either need to pull the human out of some steps,
or reduce the amount of time the users spends in each step.

# How we'll improve it

## Make agents require less human feedback
  * Can run many more code review agents before an agent comes back
  * Have the agents be more persistent (Ralph loops, etc.)
  * Have agents block interruptions to the user until an agent's work is good enough (manager/bouncer)
  * UI's morph when you think about 100 agents at once, need 
## Make it fast to review agents' work
  * Have the agent organize their work to make it easier for you to review
    * Write reports
    * Spin up dev servers for you
    * Navigate to specific pages on your site that it wants you to review
  * Have better tools for review (diff viewer, fast feedback, etc.)
  * Have quick actions like agents prepping multiple choice questions for you, have simple actions like "create PR" readily available
## Have agents be more proactive
  * Have agents proactively find new work to do
  * Have agents dig into product feedback weekly
  * Have agents investigate security gaps
  etc. etc.
