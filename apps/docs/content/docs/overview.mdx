## What is Superset?

Superset is a desktop application that helps developers work more efficiently with their codebase. It combines workspace management, terminal integration, and team collaboration into a single unified experience.

## Key Features

### Workspace Management

Organize your projects using git worktrees. Superset makes it easy to:

- Create and manage multiple worktrees for the same repository
- Switch between branches without stashing changes
- Keep your work organized across features and fixes

### Team Collaboration

Work together with your team seamlessly:

- Share workspaces with team members
- Sync configurations across devices
- Manage team permissions and access

## How It Works

Superset sits on top of your existing git workflow and enhances it with a visual interface and productivity tools. It doesn't replace git—it makes it easier to use.

### Git Worktrees

Instead of switching branches in a single directory, Superset uses git worktrees to give each branch its own directory. This means:

- No more stashing uncommitted changes
- Run multiple branches simultaneously
- Keep your IDE state intact when switching contexts

### Local-First Architecture

Your data stays on your machine. Superset works offline and syncs when you're connected.

## Tech Stack

Superset is built with modern technologies:

- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop framework
- **React** - UI components with TypeScript
- **SQLite** - Local database for fast queries
