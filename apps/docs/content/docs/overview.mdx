## What is Superset?

Superset is a desktop application that helps developers work more efficiently with their codebase. It combines workspace management, terminal integration, and team collaboration into a single unified experience.

## Key Features

## How It Works

Superset sits on top of your existing git workflow and enhances it with a visual interface and productivity tools. It doesn't replace git—it makes it easier to use.

### Git Worktrees

Instead of switching branches in a single directory, Superset uses git worktrees to give each branch its own directory. This means:

- No more stashing uncommitted changes
- Run multiple branches simultaneously
- Keep your IDE state intact when switching contexts

### Local-First Architecture

Your data stays on your machine. Superset works offline and syncs when you're connected.

## Tech Stack

Superset is built with modern technologies:

- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop framework
- **React** - UI components with TypeScript
- **SQLite** - Local database for fast queries
- **Git** - Version control integration

## Database Schema

Superset uses a local SQLite database to store workspace and session information. Here's an overview of the core tables:

<DatabaseTable
  tableName="workspaces"
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique workspace identifier (UUID)",
      isPrimaryKey: true,
      isRequired: true,
    },
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      description: "Display name for the workspace",
      isRequired: true,
    },
    {
      name: "path",
      type: "string",
      description: "Filesystem path to the git worktree",
      isRequired: true,
      isUnique: true,
    },
    {
      name: "branch",
      type: "string",
      description: "Git branch associated with this workspace",
      isRequired: true,

      description: "Path to the shell executable (e.g., /bin/bash)",
      isRequired: true,
    },
    {

      type: "string",
      description: "Current working directory for the session",
      isRequired: true,
    },
    {
      name: "isActive",
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Whether the session is currently running",
