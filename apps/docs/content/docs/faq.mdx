## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

#### What platforms does Superset support?

Currently, Superset is available exclusively for **macOS**. Windows and Linux support is planned for future releases.

#### How does Superset work with my existing Git workflow?

Superset enhances your Git workflow without replacing it. It uses [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to create isolated copies of your repository, allowing you to work on multiple branches simultaneously.

#### Do I need a Superset account?

Yes, you need to sign in to use Superset. This enables team collaboration features and syncs your settings across devices.

### Workspaces

#### Can I work on the same branch in multiple workspaces?

No. A branch can only be checked out in one workspace at a time. If you need parallel work on similar code, create a new branch from your existing one (e.g., `my-feature-v2`).

#### Where are workspaces stored on disk?

Workspaces are stored in your Superset data directory. Each workspace is a git worktree linked to your main repository.

#### How do I share workspace configuration with my team?

Create a `.superset/config.json` file in your repository and commit it. Team members will automatically use the same setup and teardown scripts.

### Terminal & Environment

#### Which shell does Superset use?

Superset uses your system's default shell (typically bash or zsh on macOS) with your standard configuration files.

#### How do I access environment variables in my scripts?

Superset provides `SUPERSET_ROOT_PATH` and `SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_NAME` to your scripts. See [Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables) for details.

#### Do terminal sessions persist after closing Superset?

Yes, terminal sessions survive app restarts. Running processes continue in the background and output history is preserved.

### Git & Version Control

#### Does Superset modify my Git configuration?

No. Superset uses standard Git commands and worktrees. It doesn't modify your global Git configuration.

#### Can I use Superset with private repositories?

Yes. Ensure you have GitHub authentication configured. Verify with `gh auth status` in your terminal.

#### How do I create a pull request from Superset?

Use the diff viewer to commit and push your changes, then click "Create PR" to open a pull request on GitHub.

### AI Agents

#### Which AI agents does Superset support?

Superset supports Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode. Each agent runs in your terminal within the isolated workspace environment.

#### Can I run multiple AI agents at once?

Yes! Create multiple workspaces and run an agent in each. This is one of Superset's key features for parallel AI-assisted development.

#### Does Superset provide its own AI capabilities?

Superset itself doesn't include AI capabilities—it provides the environment and tooling to run external AI coding agents effectively.

## Known Issues

### Terminal

#### Garbled output when switching terminal tabs

Occasionally, terminal output may appear garbled when switching between tabs while output is streaming. This is a known issue and typically resolves itself.

**Workaround**: Press `Ctrl+L` to redraw the terminal.

### Workspaces

#### Workspace creation slow on large repositories

Creating workspaces for very large repositories may take longer as git worktree creation involves copying the index.

**Workaround**: Ensure you have sufficient disk space and patience for initial setup.

### Editor Integration

#### "Open in Editor" opens wrong window

If you have multiple editor windows open, the "Open in" feature may focus an unexpected window.

**Workaround**: Close unused editor windows or use the editor's built-in file navigation.
