description: View and manage active ports per workspace

## Overview

Each workspace gets its own port range. View active ports and kill processes directly from the UI.

## Features

- **View active ports** - See which processes are using which ports
- **Kill processes** - Stop a process by clicking its port
- **No conflicts** - Each workspace has dedicated ports

## Static Port Configuration

Override automatic port discovery with a static configuration file.

Create `.superset/ports.json` in your repository:

```json
{
  "ports": [
    { "port": 3000, "label": "Frontend Dev Server" },
    { "port": 8080, "label": "API Server" },
    { "port": 5432, "label": "PostgreSQL" }
  ]
}
```

**Fields:**
- `port` - Port number (1-65535)
- `label` - Display text shown in tooltip

**Behavior:**
- Static config replaces dynamic port discovery
- Each workspace reads from its own worktree's file
- Changes are detected automatically
