### Workspace Management

Superset allows you to manage your workspaces in a way that is easy to understand and use. Each workspace is an isolated git worktree, giving you a complete copy of your codebase on a separate branch.

### Terminal Integration

Superset allows you to integrate your terminal into your workspace. Run commands, manage processes, and interact with your codebase—all without leaving the app.

### Diff Viewer & Git Operations

Review code changes, stage files, commit, and push—all from a visual interface. The diff viewer helps you understand what changed and manage your git workflow.

### AI Agent Integration

Run AI coding agents like Claude Code in isolated workspaces. Each agent gets its own environment where it can make changes without interfering with other work.

### Team Collaboration

Superset allows you to collaborate with your team. Share workspace configurations and keep everyone on the same page.

### How It Works

Superset works by sitting on top of your existing git workflow and enhancing it with a visual interface and productivity tools. It doesn't replace git—it makes it easier to use.
