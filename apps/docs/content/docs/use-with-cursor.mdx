## Opening Workspaces in Your Editor

Superset integrates seamlessly with external code editors. To open your workspace:

1. Press **⌘O** (macOS) while in a workspace
2. Or click the "Open In" button in the workspace toolbar

This opens your preferred editor at the workspace directory.

## Window Title Configuration

When managing multiple Cursor or VS Code windows, it helps to see which workspace each window belongs to. Configure your editor's window title to show the branch name:

### For Cursor / VS Code

1. Open User Settings with **⌘⇧P** and search "Preferences: Open User Settings"
2. Search for `window.title`
3. Set it to: `${activeRepositoryBranchName}${separator}${rootName}${separator}${profileName}`

This displays the branch name in your title bar, making it easy to identify which window corresponds to each workspace.

**Example title:** `my-feature — project-name — Default`

## Workflow Tips

### Split Screen Setup

For an optimal workflow, position Superset alongside your editor:

- **Left side**: Superset for workspace management, terminal, and git operations
- **Right side**: Cursor/VS Code for editing code

### Quick Switching

Use these shortcuts to move quickly between Superset and your editor:

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Open workspace in editor | ⌘O |
| Switch to Superset | ⌘Tab (macOS app switcher) |
| New workspace | ⌘N |

### Color Coding Workspaces

Consider using VS Code's Peacock extension or Cursor's workspace colors to visually distinguish between different workspaces:

1. Install [Peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock) extension
2. Assign a unique color to each workspace
3. Quickly identify which window you're in by the title bar color
