## Overview

Run multiple workspaces at once. Each is an isolated git worktree with its own branch, terminal, and ports.

## Create Workspaces

Press **⌘N** or click "New Workspace". Each gets:
- Own git branch
- Own working directory
- Own terminal sessions
- Own port range

## Use Cases

- **Parallel features** - Work on multiple features simultaneously
- **AI agents** - Run Claude Code in separate workspaces
- **Code review** - Review PRs while continuing your work

## Port Management

Each workspace gets dedicated ports to avoid conflicts. View active ports in the ports panel.
