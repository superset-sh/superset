title: Parallel Workspaces
description: Run multiple workspaces simultaneously for parallel development
---

## Overview

Superset enables you to run multiple workspaces simultaneously through isolated git worktrees. Each workspace operates independently, allowing concurrent development without interference.

## Creating Parallel Workspaces

To create a new workspace:

1. Press **⌘N** (macOS) to spawn a new workspace
2. Or click the "New Workspace" button in the sidebar

Each workspace gets its own:
- Git branch
- Working directory
- Terminal sessions
- Port assignments

## How It Works

Superset uses [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) under the hood. This means:

- Each workspace has a complete, isolated copy of your codebase
- Changes in one workspace don't affect others
- You can run different branches simultaneously
- No need to stash changes when switching contexts

## Use Cases

### Feature Development

Work on multiple features in parallel:

- Create a workspace for each feature
- Develop independently without conflicts
- Merge when ready

### AI-Assisted Development

Run multiple AI agents concurrently:

- Each agent works in its own isolated environment
- Changes from one agent don't interfere with another
- Review and merge the best solution

### Code Review

Review PRs while continuing development:

- Create a workspace from a PR
- Test and review the changes
- Continue your own work in another workspace

## Port Management

Each workspace is assigned a range of ports to prevent conflicts when running dev servers:

- Ports are automatically allocated per workspace
- Use environment variables in your scripts to access assigned ports
- View active ports in the workspace panel

## Best Practices

1. **Name workspaces clearly**: Use descriptive names that indicate the feature or task
2. **Clean up old workspaces**: Archive or delete workspaces when done to free resources
3. **Use setup scripts**: Automate workspace initialization with [setup scripts](/docs/setup-teardown-scripts)
4. **Coordinate with team**: Be mindful of shared resources like databases when running parallel workspaces
