description: Create and set up your first workspace in Superset
---

## Getting Started

After installing Superset, you can add your first repository from either a local folder or a Git URL. The platform requires GitHub authentication—verify this by running `gh auth status` in your terminal.

## Initial Setup Process

When you add a repository, Superset automatically creates a new workspace for you. This workspace functions as an isolated copy and branch of your Git repository using [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).

**Important:** Superset only copies files tracked in git. You can use a [setup script](/docs/setup-teardown-scripts) to automatically include additional files like `.env` files or run installation commands such as `bun install`.

## Creating Additional Workspaces

You have flexibility in workspace creation:

- Use the keyboard shortcut **⌘⇧N** (macOS) or click the menu button next to "New workspace"
- Create workspaces from:
  - Specific branches
  - GitHub pull requests
  - A fresh branch from main

This multi-workspace capability enables parallel feature development and collaboration on existing PRs.

## Opening Your Workspace

Once your workspace is ready, you can:

1. **Open in IDE**: Press **⌘O** to open the workspace in your preferred code editor (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
2. **Use the built-in terminal**: Start working directly in Superset's integrated terminal
3. **View changes**: Use the diff viewer to see any modifications

## Next Steps

- Learn about [setup and teardown scripts](/docs/setup-teardown-scripts) to automate workspace initialization
- Explore [parallel workspaces](/docs/parallel-workspaces) to run multiple Claude instances
- Set up [IDE integration](/docs/use-with-cursor) for a seamless workflow
