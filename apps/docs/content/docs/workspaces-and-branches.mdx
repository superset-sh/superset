title: Workspaces & Branches
description: How workspaces map to git branches
---

## Core Concept

Each workspace = one git branch. A branch can only be in one workspace at a time.

## Create Workspaces From

- **New branch** - Fresh branch from main
- **Existing branch** - Continue work on a branch
- **Pull request** - Review or continue a PR

## Branch Management

Standard git commands work in the terminal:

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature  # Create and switch
git branch -m new-name       # Rename
git branch -d old-branch     # Delete
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/auth`, `fix/login-bug`
- Don't work directly on `main`
- Delete workspaces after merging
