title: Workspaces and Branches
description: Understanding the relationship between workspaces and git branches
---

## Core Concept

In Superset, **the easiest way to identify a workspace is by which branch it's on**. Each workspace operates on a specific Git branch, making the branch the primary identifier for that workspace.

## How It Works

### Automatic Branch Creation

When you create a new workspace, Superset automatically generates a corresponding branch. You can:

- Start from `main` with a new branch name
- Create from an existing branch
- Create from a pull request

### One Branch, One Workspace

**A branch can only be checked out in one workspace at a time.** This one-to-one relationship prevents conflicts.

If you need the same branch in multiple workspaces, create a derivative branch:

```
my-feature          → workspace-1
my-feature-v2       → workspace-2
```

## Branch Management

### Switching Branches

You can switch branches within a workspace using standard Git commands in the terminal:

```bash
# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout feature-branch

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new-feature
```

### Renaming Branches

Rename your current branch:

```bash
git branch -m new-name
```

The workspace will update to reflect the new branch name.

### Viewing All Branches

See all available branches:

```bash
# Local branches
git branch

# Local and remote branches
git branch -a
```

## Creating Workspaces from Branches

### From Existing Branches

1. Click "New Workspace"
2. Select the "Branches" tab
3. Choose an existing branch to work on

### From Pull Requests

Create a workspace directly from a GitHub pull request:

1. Click "New Workspace"
2. Select the "Pull Requests" tab
3. Choose a PR to review or continue work on

## Best Practices

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names that indicate:
- The type of change (feature, fix, refactor)
- A brief description of the work

Examples:
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `fix/login-redirect-bug`
- `refactor/database-queries`

### Cleanup

After merging a feature:
1. Archive or delete the workspace
2. Delete the local and remote branch if no longer needed

```bash
# Delete local branch (after checkout another branch)
git branch -d feature-branch

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch
```

### Working with Main

Avoid working directly on `main`. Instead:
1. Create a new workspace with a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Create a PR to merge back to `main`
4. After merging, delete the feature workspace
