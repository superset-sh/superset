## Overview

The Diff Viewer enables you to review all changes made to your codebase—whether by you or by an AI agent—and helps you manage your Git workflow through to merging your PR.

## Viewing Changes

After making changes to your workspace, the Diff Viewer displays:

- **Modified files**: See exactly what lines were added, removed, or changed
- **Staged vs unstaged**: Distinguish between changes ready to commit and working directory changes
- **Line counts**: Quick summary of additions and deletions per file

## Git Operations

The Diff Viewer integrates with Git to provide a streamlined workflow:

### Staging Files

Select files to stage for your next commit. You can stage individual files or all changes at once.

### Committing Changes

Write a commit message and commit your staged changes directly from the interface.

### Push and Pull

Sync your changes with the remote repository:

- **Push**: Send your local commits to GitHub
- **Pull**: Fetch and merge remote changes
- **Sync**: Perform both operations in sequence

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of push/pull/sync buttons */}
![Git Sync](<!-- IMAGE: Screenshot showing push, pull, and sync buttons in the toolbar -->)

## Creating Pull Requests

Once your changes are pushed, you can create a pull request directly from Superset:

1. Click the "Create PR" button
2. Review the changes that will be included
3. Add a title and description
4. Submit the PR to GitHub

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of PR creation flow */}

## Diff Layout Options

Customize how you view diffs:

- **Split view**: See old and new versions side by side
- **Unified view**: See changes inline with context

{/* TODO: Add screenshot showing both diff layout options */}

## Tips

- Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between changed files quickly
- Review changes before committing to catch unintended modifications
- Stage related changes together for cleaner commit history
