description: Use AI coding agents like Claude Code with Superset
---

## Overview

Superset integrates with AI coding agents to enable AI-assisted development. Each workspace provides an isolated environment where agents can make changes without interfering with other work.

## Supported Agents

Superset supports the following AI coding agents:

- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's CLI for Claude
- **Codex** - OpenAI's coding assistant
- **OpenCode** - Open-source alternative

## Setting Up Claude Code

### Prerequisites

Before using Claude Code with Superset:

1. Install Claude Code: Follow the [official setup guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
2. Authenticate: Run `claude /login` in your terminal

### Using Claude Code

Once installed, you can use Claude Code directly in Superset's terminal:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Or with a specific prompt
claude "Help me refactor this function"
```

## Parallel Agent Development

One of Superset's key features is running multiple agents in parallel:

1. **Create multiple workspaces**: Each workspace is isolated
2. **Run an agent in each**: Start Claude Code or another agent in each workspace
3. **Compare results**: Review changes across workspaces
4. **Merge the best solution**: Use the diff viewer to select and commit changes

### Benefits

- **Isolation**: Agents can't interfere with each other
- **Experimentation**: Try different approaches simultaneously
- **Speed**: Tackle multiple tasks concurrently
- **Comparison**: Compare different AI-generated solutions

## Agent Notifications

Superset can notify you when an agent completes its work:

- Sound notifications when a task finishes
- Focus notifications to bring attention to completed work
- Customizable notification sounds in Settings

## Best Practices

### Clear Instructions

Give agents clear, specific instructions:

```bash
# ✅ Good - specific and actionable
claude "Add error handling to the fetchUser function in src/api/users.ts.
Handle network errors and return a typed error object."

# ❌ Vague - too broad
claude "Fix the errors"
```

### Review Changes

Always review agent-generated changes before committing:

1. Use the [diff viewer](/docs/diff-viewer) to see all changes
2. Check for unintended modifications
3. Verify the solution meets your requirements
4. Test the changes before merging

### Workspace Cleanup

After an agent completes work:

1. Review and commit useful changes
2. Discard unwanted modifications
3. Delete or archive the workspace if no longer needed

## Environment Configuration

### API Keys

Configure your AI provider API keys in your shell environment:

```bash
# In your .zshrc or .bashrc
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### Custom Agent Configuration

Some agents support configuration files. Place these in your home directory or workspace as needed:

```bash
# Claude Code settings
~/.claude/settings.json

# Project-specific prompts
.claude/commands/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not found

If the agent command isn't recognized:

```bash
# Check if installed
which claude

# Reinstall if needed
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Authentication issues

Re-authenticate if you encounter permission errors:

```bash
claude /login
```

### Agent hanging

If an agent becomes unresponsive:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` to interrupt
2. If that doesn't work, close the terminal tab
3. Start a fresh terminal session
