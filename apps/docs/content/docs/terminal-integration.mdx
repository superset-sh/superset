description: Use Superset's built-in terminal for powerful session management
---

## Overview

Superset includes a built-in terminal with powerful session management. Run commands, manage processes, and interact with your codebase—all without leaving the app.

## Terminal Features

### Multiple Sessions

Open multiple terminal tabs per workspace:

- Each tab runs an independent shell session
- Tabs persist across app restarts
- Quick access to common commands

### Session Persistence

Your terminal sessions survive app restarts:

- Running processes continue in the background
- Session history is preserved
- Output scrollback is maintained

### Initial Commands

When creating a new workspace, Superset can automatically run initial commands based on your [setup scripts](/docs/setup-teardown-scripts).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| New terminal tab | ⌘T |
| Close terminal tab | ⌘W |
| Clear terminal | ⌘K |
| Split terminal | ⌘D |
| Navigate tabs | ⌘1-9 |

## Terminal Environment

### Working Directory

Each terminal session starts in your workspace directory. The full path is available via environment variables:

```bash
pwd  # Outputs: /path/to/worktrees/my-workspace
echo $SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_NAME  # Outputs: my-workspace
```

### Environment Variables

Superset provides [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables) to your terminal sessions:

- `SUPERSET_ROOT_PATH` - Path to the root repository
- `SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_NAME` - Current workspace name

### Shell Configuration

Superset uses your default shell (bash or zsh) with your standard configuration files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

## Working with Processes

### Starting Dev Servers

Start your development server directly in the terminal:

```bash
bun run dev
```

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of dev server running */}
![Dev Server Running](<!-- IMAGE: Screenshot of terminal with a dev server running and showing output -->)

### Background Processes

Run processes in the background using standard shell operators:

```bash
# Run in background
bun run dev &

# View background jobs
jobs

# Bring to foreground
fg %1
```

### Port Management

Superset tracks active ports in your workspace. View which processes are using which ports in the ports panel.

## Links in Terminal

Terminal output containing URLs and file paths is clickable:

- **URLs**: Click to open in your default browser
- **File paths**: Click to open in your configured editor
- **Error locations**: Click stack trace file references to jump to the file

{/* TODO: Add screenshot showing clickable links */}

## Tips

### Quick File Access

Use terminal commands to quickly access and modify files:

```bash
# Open file in your editor
code path/to/file.ts

# Or with Cursor
cursor path/to/file.ts
```

### Command History

Access previous commands with arrow keys or search:

```bash
# Search history
Ctrl+R

# Previous command
Up Arrow
```

### Customizing Your Shell

Add workspace-specific aliases to your shell configuration:

```bash
# In your .zshrc or .bashrc
alias dev="bun run dev"
alias test="bun run test"
alias build="bun run build"
```
