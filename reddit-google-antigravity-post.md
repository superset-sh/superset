> terminal that won't kill your agent sessions when you close or restart

## Post

built a terminal where sessions persist by default. close the app, reopen, your agent is still running. even crashes restore from disk.

no tmux. no config. just works.

useful for long-running agent tasks where you don't want to babysit the window.
