# CLI — Implementation TODOs

## Infrastructure changes (before CLI can be built)

- [ ] **Host service writes `~/.superset/device.json`** on startup with `{ deviceId, deviceName }` for CLI auto-detection
- [ ] **Move port scanner to host service** — currently lives in Electron (`apps/desktop/src/main/lib/terminal/port-manager.ts`). Host service needs its own port scanning so headless/CLI-driven terminals get port detection too
- [ ] **Add `ports` table to host service SQLite** — track detected and claimed ports per workspace/terminal session
- [ ] **Consolidate host/client identity** — drop `id` UUID surrogate on both `v2_hosts` and `v2_clients`. `machineId` (output of `getHashedDeviceId()` on desktop; OS-provided device IDs on mobile; persisted localStorage UUIDs on web) becomes the canonical row identity end-to-end. New PKs: `v2_hosts(organizationId, machineId)`, `v2_clients(organizationId, userId, machineId)`. Four FKs on the host side migrate uuid → text composite (`v2_users_hosts.hostId`, `v2_workspaces.hostId`, `automations.targetHostId`, `automation_runs.hostId`); v2_clients has zero FKs to migrate. Drop the dead `session_hosts` table (no writes anywhere in the codebase, no renderer consumers). Code search-and-replace in `packages/trpc/src/router/{device,automation/automation,automation/dispatch,v2-workspace}/...`. Required prereq for CLI v1's local-detection routing — see `packages/cli/CLI_SPEC_TARGET.md`.
- [ ] **Add `chat.list` tRPC query** — currently no server-side list for chat sessions (desktop uses Electric sync). CLI needs this
- [ ] **CDP target mapping** — add a way to map `paneId` → CDP `webSocketDebuggerUrl` so external tools can connect to specific browser panes. Likely a new tRPC procedure on `browser` router
- [ ] **CDP in production** — currently gated to `NODE_ENV === "development"`. Need a strategy for production (selective enable? proxy through BrowserManager?)

## New schemas

- [ ] **`crons` table** (cloud, Neon) — `id, organization_id, device_id, name, schedule, prompt, enabled, created_by_user_id, last_run_at, next_run_at`
- [ ] **`cron_runs` table** (cloud, Neon) — `id, cron_id, organization_id, status, started_at, completed_at, output, error`
- [ ] **`ports` table** (host service SQLite) — `port, workspace_id, terminal_id, url, detected_at, claimed_at`

## Desktop app changes

- [x] **Sidebar sections** — host-owned sidebar sections (workspace groups) now exist: `sidebar_sections` table + `section_id`/`tab_order` on workspaces, a `sections` tRPC router, desktop UI, and `superset workspaces groups`/`move` CLI commands.
- [ ] **Websocket command routing** — CLI spec says device commands route via API → websocket → host service. Is this path built? Or does it still go through `agentCommands` + Electric SQL polling?

## CLI package

- [ ] Scaffold `packages/cli/`
- [ ] Auth flow (`login` / `logout` / `whoami`)
- [ ] Cloud commands (`tasks`, `devices`, `chat`)
- [ ] Device commands (`workspaces`, `projects`, `agent`)
- [ ] UI commands (`focus`, `sidebar`, `tabs`, `panes`)
- [ ] Pane-type commands (`terminal send/read`, `browser navigate/cdp-url`, `chat send/read`)
- [ ] Port commands (`list`, `claim`, `release`)
- [ ] Cron commands (`list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `logs`, `run`)
